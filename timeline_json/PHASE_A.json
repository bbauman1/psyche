        "In September of 2015, the Psyche Mission (as it was proposed in Step 1) was selected by NASA to develop a detailed concept study for consideration for NASA’s Discovery Program. (Step 1 is the initial proposal stage; the team had been working on the idea since 2011 and submitted a 256 page Step 1 proposal that was selected for the Phase A concept study.)",
        "A large team worked on the study, led by the Principal Investigator, Lindy Elkins-Tanton, and consisting of an expansive team that included scientists, engineers, project managers, schedulers, financial modelers, graphic designers, and marketing leads from ASU, JPL, SSL, as well as more than a dozen other universities and research organizations.",
        "In November of 2016, the team presented the proposed mission to 30 NASA reviewers during a nine-hour “site visit” which included a tour of SSL’s high bay, where the Psyche chassis will be built.",
        "The site visit is an intense, highly technical in-person review done by a select group of science, technical, and industry experts. They review every detail of the proposed mission, from concept and design, to execution and science application, as well as how the mission personnel from different institutions work together as a team."
