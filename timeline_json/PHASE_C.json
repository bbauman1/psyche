        "Science and engineering teams begin to build their instruments.",
        "The instruments consist of a magnetometer, a multispectral imager, and a gamma ray and neutron spectrometer.",
        "The mission will use an X-band radio telecommunications system to measure Psyche’s gravity field to high precision. When combined with topography derived from onboard imagery, this will provide information on the interior structure of Psyche.",
        "The mission will also test a sophisticated new laser communication technology that encodes data in photons (rather than radio waves) to communicate between a probe in deep space and Earth. Using light instead of radio allows the spacecraft to communicate more data in a given amount of time.",
        "April 2020, the teams will undergo Project and Flight System Critical Design Review, this is an integral step in the instrument engineering process.",
        "The bus or “body” of the spacecraft will be completed by May 2020",
        "In January 2021, the team will conduct the Systems Integration Review to ensure that the system is ready to be integrated. The last step in Phase C is Key Decision Point D that will give the team the official approval to move to the next phase."
